[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template)

Serenity/JS is a next generation acceptance testing framework. Learn more at [serenity-js.org](https://serenity-js.org)!

This repository was created using the [Serenity/JS Jasmine Protractor Template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template) and contains code samples demonstrated in the [Full-Stack Acceptance Testing with Serenity/JS and the Screenplay Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djPMf-n93Rw) talk:

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need:
- Node.js, a Long-Term Support (LTS) release version 10 or later - [download](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later - [download](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- Chrome web browser - [download](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/)

## Usage

```
npm ci                  # installs the node modules
npm run lint            # runs the code linter
npm start               # starts the web server with a demo app
npm test                # executes the example tests and generates the report under ./target/site/serenity
```

_**Please note**: to keep things simple, this demo assumes that you start the app server using `npm start` 
before running the tests via `npm test`. 
If you'd like to automate the process of starting the server up for the tests and shutting it down after,
have a look at the [`@serenity-js/local-server`](https://serenity-js.org/modules/local-server/) module._
